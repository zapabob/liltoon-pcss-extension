# v1.4.9 Release Packaging & Final Fix Implementation Log

## Date
2025-06-23

## Summary
This log details the process of resolving the final compilation errors, packaging version 1.4.9 for release, updating the VPM repository, and preparing for the GitHub release.

## Problem
After fixing initial compilation errors and attempting to push to the repository, new issues arose, including a `non-fast-forward` Git error and a final compilation error related to `Unity.EditorCoroutines`. The release process needed to be restarted after these fixes to ensure a stable, clean package.

## Solution

### 1. Final Compilation Error Resolution
- **Problem**: A `CS0234` error indicated that the namespace `Unity.EditorCoroutines` was missing.
- **Root Cause**: The `lilToon.PCSS.Editor.asmdef` file lacked a reference to the `Unity.EditorCoroutines.Editor` assembly. Additionally, the root `package.json` was missing the dependency `com.unity.editor-coroutines`.
- **Fix**:
    1.  Added `"Unity.EditorCoroutines.Editor"` to the `references` array in `Editor/lilToon.PCSS.Editor.asmdef`.
    2.  Added `"com.unity.editor-coroutines": "1.0.0"` to the `dependencies` in the root `package.json`.
    3.  Committed and pushed these changes to the remote repository.

### 2. Release Repackaging
- **Action**: Executed the `create_clean_v1.4.9_package_final.py` script to generate a new, clean zip package (`com.liltoon.pcss-extension-1.4.9-final.zip`) containing all the latest fixes.
- **Verification**: Confirmed the script output, noting the new SHA256 hash: `1F5AE7459F0D58A05E18C29CC623BD84E9DE5AC59591660FED625904D5F1E26A`.

### 3. VPM Repository Update
- **Action**: Manually edited the `docs/vpm.json` file.
- **Changes**:
    - Updated the `url` for the `v1.4.9` entry to point to `.../com.liltoon.pcss-extension-1.4.9-clean.zip`.
    - Updated the `zipSHA256` to the newly generated hash.
- **Git Operations**:
    - Staged the changes (`git add docs/vpm.json`).
    - Committed the changes with the message `docs(vpm): v1.4.9のパッケージ情報を更新`.
    - Pushed the commit to the `main` branch.

### 4. GitHub Release Preparation
- **Action**: Renamed the generated package from `...-final.zip` to `...-clean.zip` to match the URL in the VPM file.
- **Action**: Ran the `create_github_release_v1.4.9.py` script.
- **Output**: The script generated the final `gh release create` command, ready for manual execution.

## Result
All compilation errors were successfully resolved. The project is now stable. A clean release package for v1.4.9 has been created, the VPM repository information has been updated and pushed to GitHub, and the command for creating the GitHub release is ready. The project is fully prepared for the v1.4.9 release.
